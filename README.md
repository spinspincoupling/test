# test
a simple web app to modify JSON file

This is a web app to modify student information on JSON.
It is run on localhost:3000
The app starts with npm start

The JSON file the app is reading is sample.json.
Each student has a ID, a name, a gender, a faculty and a year

Validation of input:
ID must be integer
To add a new student, one must provide a ID and a name
otherwise alert

Lookup by ID:
if not found produce an alert


Sorry I did not write any tests because I am not so familiar with writing tests to test a web API
BTW if the "new Student" button does not work on first time, please click it a second time
